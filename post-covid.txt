The seller did everything right and hired a well-known and reputable sewer company (we all know the name) to replace the sewer line in its entirety in 2013 at an expense over $7K. The paid invoice states an entire new line with double wye cleanouts etc. To the Seller's surprise, the buyer terminated at inspection as their sewer scope revealed that there was actually still some clay pipe (and therefore the entire line was not fully replaced after all) as well as no proper cleanouts...it was only a partial repair?! The sewer company has now scoped the line again and admitted all fault. They will be replacing the line in its entirety with plastic on 8/24/2020. Property History of Ownership is Inaccurate on Zillow and other Sites. One owner since 2012 (please check county assessor). Note the 3rd bath is just roughed-out in the basement (not currently a fully functioning bath).
